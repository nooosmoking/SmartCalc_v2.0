  <h3>General information</h3>
  <p>
    The program inplement an engineering version of calculator and have a simpe interface with input windows and 'equal' button.
    <br> The engine of program works by <i>Dijkstra's algorithm</i> and every expresson translate into <i>Reverse Polish
      (bracketless) notation</i> and then calculate.
    <br>Also Smart_Calc builds graphs in new window with coordinate grid.
  </p>
  <h3>Operations</h3>
  <p>
    Smart_Calc has ordinary operations with numbers, like <b>*, /, +, -, mod, pow</b>.<br> User can prioritize
    operations
    by using <b>(, )</b>.
    <br>For delete last action simbol <b>Backspace</b>.
  </p>
  <h3>Functions</h3>
  <p>
    Smart_Calc has opportunity to calculate some functions, like <b>cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), acos(x),
      asin(x), atan(x), sqrt(x), ln(x), log(x)</b>.
    <br> User can get a result with any number or can input unknown variable (<b>x</b>) and choose value <b>x</b> via
    input window.
  </p>
  <h3>Graph</h3>
  <p>
    Smart_Calc has opportunity to draw a graph of input expression automaticly when 'equal' button is pressed.
